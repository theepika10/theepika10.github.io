                       <p>Economics is a social science and it is based on assumptions. It focuses on the consumption, production and distribution of goods and services. The fundamental economic problem stems from the fact that we have infinite needs and wants however finite scarce rescources. Rescources include land, labour, capital and entreprenurship. The main economic agents that Economics surrounds itself around is consumers, firms and the government. The subject of Economics can be split into many categories; Microeconomics, Macroeconomics and Econometrics being a few of the many. Microeconomics revolves around the nation's economy. Macroeconomics expands to a global scale. Econometrics is more the mathematical side of Economics.</p> 
                       <blockquote>
                        "When my information changes, I alter my conclusions. What do you do sir?" - <cite>John Maynard Keynes</cite>
                       </blockquote>
                       <p> Did you know that economics can also affect my cat? ü§Ø
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Economics is extremely important to our world not only because it affects the people in finance and banking, but because it affects everyone, that includes me, you, your next door neighbour and even my cat. Economics involves interest rates, inflation, taxes, income, policies and government intervention. All the factors above help the world function properly and a change in the slightest way to any of these factors can affect the way the world functions. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Now you must wonder ü§î - "How on earth does Economics affect your cat?" - Well the answer to that is inflation. If inflation, which is the increase in the general price level, occurs then the prices of goods and services would increase which would mean cat food that my cat, Kitcha, eats would also increase in price. This could affect my actions on what cat food I buy for Kitcha as I might opt for a less expensive substitute cat food from another brand This would mean Kitcha may not get the cat food from this preferred and favoured brand, thus this affects my cat üê±. Hence, Economics is imperative to the world we live in!</p>

                       <p>Even though the study of Economics probably dates back thousands of years ago, when we talk about modern day Economics, economists without fail refer to Adam Smith, who is known as 'The Father of Modern Economics'. Smith was the author of the renowned 'Wealth of Nations' published in 1776 and founded the idea of the 'invisible hand'. üìñ ‚úã </p> 
                       <blockquote>
                        "A nation is not made wealthy by the childish accumulation of shiny metals, but it is enriched by the economic prosperity of it's people." - <cite>Adam Smith</cite>
                       </blockquote>
                       <p> A few economists who disagreed with the views of Adam Smith inlcude Karl Marx and Thomas Malthus. They supported a command/planned economy whereas Adam Smith believed in a free-market economy. Malthus was an economist who believed that a growing population would mean insufficient food supply. Marx believed that workers were being exploited by firm owners in capitalist economies (free-market economy).
                       </p>
                       <p> When talking about Economics, there is always a mention regarding Classical Economics and Keynesian Economics. Keynesian Economics was developed by John Maynard Keynes, and it was seen a new branch of Economics. Keynes believed that the Economics that existed before 'Keynesian Economics', which is known as Classical Economics, didn't take into account the operation of the economy as a whole.

                       <p>In this section I would like to give you a little insight of the fundamentals of economics. I will discuss supply, demand, show and explain a few diagrams and finally touch on aggregate demand and aggregate supply. </p> 
                       
                       <p>Demand is the quantity of goods or services that consumers are willing to buy at a given price. Supply is the quantity of goods or services that a producer is willing to sell at a given price. An equilibrium point is essentially where both supply and demand are equal to each other. In Economics it is well known by all economists that as the price of a good or service increases then supply increases as producers are able to make more possible revenue and profit, but demand will simultaneously decrease as consumers aren't willing to pay a higher price. The opposite applies as the price of a good or service decreases; demand increases and supply decreases. Below I have attached three diagrams I drew to demonstrate supply and demand. <br>
                        <br>
                         Diagram 1 is a simple supply and demand diagram where price is on the y-axis/vertical axis and quantity demanded is on the x-axis/horizontal axis. The equilibrium point, where supply=demand and essentially the market clears, is indicated by the point A, which is at a price of ¬£3 and a quantity of 100. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <img src="diagram1.jpg" alt="A picture of a simple supply and demand diagram">
                        <br> 
                        <br>
                        Diagram 2 is another simple supply and demand diagram however in this case the price of the good (or service) has increased from ¬£3 to ¬£4 which has caused a contraction in the demand curve reducing the quantity demanded to decrease from 100 to 50 units (indicated by point B). This because at a higher price consumers become less willing to pay for the good (or service) at this higher price. In contrast to the effect on demand, the effect on supply is seen as the quantity supplied increases from 100 to 150 units (indicated by point C) at the new price of ¬£4. This can be described as a expansion in the supply curve and this happens as at a higher price producers are willing to supply more as they are able to make more revenue and thus more profit. This effects caused to the supply and demand curves can be called movements along the curves and movements are caused by a change in price.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <img src="diagram2.jpg" alt="A picture of a simple supply and demand diagram with an increase in price">
                        <br>
                         Diagram 3 is again another simple supply and demand diagram however this time we can see a right shift in the demand curve from D to D1, which could have been caused by multiple factors, for example the increase in price of a substitute, an increase in advertising for the good/service or even a decrease in the price of a complementary good. This shift in the demand curve increases quantity demanded from 100 to 150 units and increases the price of the good/service from ¬£3 to ¬£4. This results in a new equilibrium shown by point F. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <img src="diagram3.jpg" alt="A picture of a simple supply and demand diagram with a shift in the demand curve to the right">
                        <br>
                    </p>

                       <p>Finally I would like to touch a little bit on aggregate demand, abbreviated to AD, and aggregate supply, abbreviated to AS. The diagram 4 below shows a simple AS/AD diagram with price level on the y-axis, real GDP on the x-axis and the equilibrium point indicated by point Z. AD is the total demand of good and services in an economy, whereas AS is the total supply of goods and services in an economy. The formula for AD is given by the sum of consumption, investment, government spending and net exports (which is exports - imports).
                        <blockquote>
                            "AD = C + I + G + (X-M)" - <cite> AD Formula</cite>
                           </blockquote>

                    <p>- There are many finance jobs you could secure with an Economics degree and such jobs are the most common. For example accounting, investment banking, asset management, financial analyst or consulting. <br><br>
                        - The average salary is around ¬£44k, however can go lower or higher. <br><br>
                        - Hours can range from 40/50 hrs per week to 100 hrs per week (can expect the latter in investment banking).</p>
                    <p>- You could become an economist or more specifically an economist for a specific company. You would utilise your economics knowledge to, for example, record what is happening in the economy and use assumptions to predict trends and events.<br><br>
                        - The average salary is around ¬£46k. <br><br>
                        - Hours on average are around 40 hrs per week.<p>
                    <p>- If you enjoy teaching Economics you could become an Economics teacher. In addition to this, if you would like to continue researching around the subject of Economics, whilst also teaching students, sharing your knowledge, you may enjoy becoming a lecturer.<br><br>
                        - The average salary is around ¬£41k (lecturer) or ¬£38k (economics teacher)<br><br>
                        - Hours on average are around 40 hrs per week (lecturer) or 21 hrs per week (economics teacher) but this can increase, for example during exam season and along with this outside of work you may need to work extra hours due to marking.<p>

                        <p>Enthusiam is our first value and is an extremely important value for us, because when it comes to learning if you don't have enthusiam towards what you are  learning it is hard to find a passion for it and we also believe learning with enthusiam  would help you understand and retain it more easily.</p>
                        <p>Committment is a second value of ours and we believe it is important since when you learn a new subject, like Economics, without committment towards your learning it would be difficult to learn and instead when the learning becomes more difficult, you are more likely to give up. We want you to always perservere and never give up.  <p>
                        <p>Collaboration is our third value and we show importance to this value because we believe that in a learning environment there are many occassions where you would need to work as a team and collaborate. This could include a fellow peer not understanding something and we believe it is important to help them and therefore work as a team, collaborating together.<p>
